        R program that does the following:
        	* Reads the data from the HAR files in the working directory for both the test and train sets
        	* Creates one data set by merging the individual sets
            * Creates a new set with only the variables pertaining to mean, standard deviation, and mean frequency
	        * Renames activity labels and featuresâ€™ labels to create more descriptive and neat labels
            * Creates a second tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
